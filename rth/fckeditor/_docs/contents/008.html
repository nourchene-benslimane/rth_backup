		<H1>Scripts Compression</H1>
		<P>The editor&nbsp;scripts source can be found in the package at the 
			"editor/_source/" directory. It is "human readable" as well as 
			commented.&nbsp;There are a lot of files there that are organized on groups.</P>
		<P>
			To maximize loading and execution performance, the&nbsp;production 
			distribution&nbsp;code in compressed on <STRONG>fewer</STRONG> and <STRONG>smaller</STRONG>
			files, as described on "<A href="003.html">Performance</A>". These files can be 
			found at the "editor/js/" directory.</P>
		<H3>How to develop using the "_source" files?</H3>
		<P>It is possible to run the editor using the&nbsp;original scripts&nbsp;in the 
			"_source" directory. It is usefull when developing or debugging&nbsp;the 
			editor.&nbsp;It is quite easy to do that. Just&nbsp;go the "editor" directory 
			and overwrite <STRONG>fckeditor.html</STRONG> with <STRONG>fckeditor.original.html</STRONG>
			(remember to backup the first one).</P>
		<P>So, to start using again the "compressed" files, just recover the backup 
			"fckeditor.html" file.</P>
		<H3>Generating the compressed scripts</H3>
		<P>
			An application has been developed to make it easy to update the compressed file 
			in the "js" directory. It is called "<STRONG>FCKeditor.Packager</STRONG>". Your 
			can download it from our web pages at <A href="http://www.fckeditor.net/download/" target="_blank">
				http://www.fckeditor.net/download/</A>
		.
		<P>Further documentation is available in the packager file itself.</P>

INSTALLATION

The following details the basic steps for installation on any system.  The
instructions will work fine on a Linux or Windows systems.
Barring complications, it should take you about 10-20 minutes to install,
configure, and start using rth.

If you are upgrading, please read /rth/sql/[version]_upgrade_db.sql
This file will contain directions for upgrading

# --- Requirements ----------

* MySQL 3.23.2 and higher
* PHP 4.1.3 and higher
* a webserver

# --- Summary ---------------

1. Copy rth directory to web server document root.
2. Create database 
3. Edit configuration file
4. Login

# --- Detail ----------------

1. First, transfer the file to your webserver using whatever method you like (ftp, scp, etc).  
You will need to telnet/ssh into the server machine for the next steps.

2. untar/gunzip it to the web server document root.
The usual command is (1 step):

	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>

OR  (2 steps):

	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>


3. Create the rth database
	There are two databases located under /rth/sql
	db.sql - This file creates a database with a single project with one user
	demo.sql - This file contains a database with some example data in the demo project.
		   This configuration is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED unless you have some experience with
                   the rth setup.
	Create an empty database called rth
	Now run the following command from the command line: mysql -u [username] -p [db_name] < demo.sql

3a. Update the rth database
	If you are upgrading from a prior version of rth, check the /rth/sql directory for updates to the database schema
	Look for a file name [version]_update_db.sql ( 1.5.1_update_db.sql for example )
	If you find a file that's related to the version of rth you're downloading, you'll want to run the updates
	in the .sql file against the rth database

4. Configure /api/properties_inc.php
	1. Set web server settings
	2. Enter database information
	3. Set the file upload path.  This will be used to store docs
	4. Select Login Method.  (MD5 is default. LDAP has not been tested thoroughly.)
	5. Turn javascript ON or OFF
		rth does a check at login to find out if a user has javascript enabled.
		If you know that the majority of your users have javascript disabled, you
		may want to turn off all javascript functionality.
	6. Turn FCKeditor ON or OFF
		You must have javascript enabled if you want to use FCKeditor
		Turning this on will make all html textarea objects appear as a WYSIWYG object
	7. Set debug options
	8. Set e-mail options
		Set the e-mail administrator - user or group that receives e-mail from users
					     - see the admin link on the home page
		Set sendmail equal to true or false.  The system will send no mail if turned off.
		Select the smtp server name
		Note: the full e-mail functionality for bugs is not yet complete

5. Move file upload directories for DEMO project
	There are four directories under the rth directory that are intended for file 
	upload for the DEMO project.
	You may want to move these directories from your web root directory to another 	
	location.  
	create the following directories under the FILE_UPLOAD_PATH (../rth_file_upload/)
	/DEMO_req_docs
	/DEMO_test_docs
	/DEMO_test_run_docs
	/DEMO_test_plan_docs
	You will have to update the file upload paths in the project table in the database
	if you decide to move these directories.

6. Login
	http://server_name/rth/login.php
	uname: admin
	pword: password

7. You can rename the DEMO project to begin using it as a project for your application.  Perhaps "project" is the wrong name.
   If you are testing software, it is probably best to think of a project as the application that you're testing.   


# --- FAQ ----------------
 
Below are a few debugging tecniques if you're having basic problems with the installation
I've listed solutions to problems that are frequently asked.

1. Is your web server running?  
	Try opening http://server_name in your web browser
	You should see a splash screen with information about your web server.
	If not, you need to review your web server documentation

2. Is php running?
	If you're having a problem opening http://server_name/rth/login.php try checking your php installation
	create a file called test.php and place the following lines in the file
		<?php
		phpinfo();
		?>
	Save this file to the document root of your web server.  Typically, "htdocs" if you're using Apache or "wwwroot" if you're using IIS.
	Now try opening test.php in your browser http://server_name/test.php
	You should get a page that gives you information about your php installation
	If not, you probably need to configure your web server to interpret php pages.  
	There are many useful tutorials on the internet

3. Database errors?
	Make sure that the database is enabled in php.  MySQL is now installed by default with php but you may have to 
		enable MySQL if you're running an older version of php.
	You also may have a problem with permissions to the database.  Check the mysql database for permissions.
